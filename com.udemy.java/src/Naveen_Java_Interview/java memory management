divided into two parts
1-Heap memory  2-Stack memory
the memory of heap memory>>> that of stack.

heap memory :
-stores all objects and JRE classes
--GC only runs here
divided into young generation and old generation.
young generation:
further divided into eden/survivor s1/ survivors2 memory.
minor GC runs here
old generation:
has method pool--- stores immutable obj like string pool and string class . defined at runtime by JVM managers
major GC runs here.
slow as many obj are stored here.
TimeOut errors

stack memory:
has permanent generation--->
stores al the meta data of classes and methods that are not part of heap memory and generated at run time.
has method area(static &constant variables;class structure )
        which further has permanent constant pool(stores static and constant variables)
method block--->present in java stack memory it gives memory to method that is being executed.
java stack memory:
--stores local variables(method specific vars)
--stores obj references
